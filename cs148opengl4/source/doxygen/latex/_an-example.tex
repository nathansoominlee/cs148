{\em timestamp} & object moves at 10 meters per second and you want it to move forward when you hit the \textquotesingle{}W\textquotesingle{} key. How many units do you move forward by? You would move forward by $10 \cdot deltaTime$ Although you get an input immediately, if you want to make a change to the scene, it is highly recommended that you queue a change and then process it within the Tick() function. This allows you to multiply by the appropriate delta when making a change\\
